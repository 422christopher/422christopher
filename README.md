<h3> 📌 &nbsp;About Me </h3>
Hi fellow colleagues! I'm a data scientist passionate about helping people leverage data to make well-informed decisions, and not whimsical ones. My master's in instructional psychology and technology taught me to have a research- and data-oriented mindset, while my time at BloomTech taught me the technical skills I need to leverage big data.

I have a background in education and technology. I have always been passionate about leveraging technology to find data insights that help people. For my master's program, I studied the effectiveness of an educational technology that helped university students learn better. Currently, I'm a high school science teacher, where I have learned the grind of teaching, classroom management, and curriculum development. While I have mainly focused in education, I am branching out to other industries as I play with more data. 🙂

💻 I pursued software development through BloomTech's data science program, where I gained the tools I needed in order to find data insights and create predictive models. This career path is a perfect blend of my education experience and my passion to make a difference in people's lives with data. I can't wait to join a company that aligns with my values and allows me to thrive as a data facilitator!

🌙 My moonlight project is to create a conversational AI math teacher that can help kids learn math and get their individual questions answered, thus alleviating the teacher's load and also providing more time for teachers to teach creativity. I would love to work in an NLP-based position.
